# Covid 19- Logistic Regression- R Programming

In this notebook you will find an exploratory process through the Argentina Covid 19 Situation Dataset.
This information was taken from the following [link](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/noticias/datos-abiertos-en-contexto-del-covid-19).

Then, I selected the most significant variables and created a model based on the logistic regression algorithm. 
The idea of this model is to predict if a person will survive or not, based on their characteristics. 

Centered on the final results dropped by the model, we can conclude that the most important variables were:
+ Sex
+ Asistencia_respiratoria_mecanica
+ Edad

Also, as the residual deviance is smaller than the null deviance, this tell us that the model works correctly. 

Hope you find this work helpful, and every comment or suggestion is welcomed!

Ramiro.
